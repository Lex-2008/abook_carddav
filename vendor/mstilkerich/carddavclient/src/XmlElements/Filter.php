    /**
     * Constructs a Filter consisting of zero or more PropFilter elements.
     *
     * For ease of use, the $conditions parameter can take a simple form, which allows exactly one match criterion per
     * VCard property. Or it can take a more elaborate form where for each property, _several_ lists of match criteria
     * can be defined.
     *
     * Note that property names can be prefixed with a group name like "GROUP.EMAIL" to only match properties that
     * belong to the given group. If no group prefix is given, the match applies to all properties of the type,
     * independent of whether they belong to a group or not.
     *
     * __Simple form__
     *
     * The simple form is an associative array mapping property names to null or a filter condition.
     *
     * A filter condition can either be a string with a text match specification (see TextMatch constructor for format)
     * or a two-element array{string,?string} where the first element is the name of a parameter and the second is a
     * string for TextMatch or null with a meaning as for a property filter.
     *
     * Examples for the simple form:
     *  - `['EMAIL' => null]`: Matches all VCards that do NOT have an EMAIL property
     *  - `['EMAIL' => "//"]`: Matches all VCards that DO have an EMAIL property (with any value)
     *  - `['EMAIL' => '/@example.com/$']`:
     *     Matches all VCards that have an EMAIL property with an email address of the example.com domain
     *  - `['EMAIL' => '/@example.com/$', 'N' => '/Mustermann;/^']`:
     *     Like before, but additionally/alternatively the surname must be Mustermann (depending on $matchAll)
     *  - `['EMAIL' => ['TYPE' => '/home/=']]`:
     *     Matches all VCards with an EMAIL property that has a TYPE parameter with value home
     *
     * __Elaborate form__
     *
     * The more elaborate form is an array of two-element arrays where the first element is a property name and
     * the second element is any of the values possible in the simple form, or an array object with a list of
     * conditions of which all/any need to apply, plus an optional key "matchAll" that can be set to true to indicate
     * that all conditions need to match (AND semantics).
     *
     * Examples for the elaborate form:
     *  - `[['EMAIL', ['/@example.com/$', ['TYPE', '/home/='], 'matchAll' => true]], ['N', '/Mustermann;/^']]`:
     *     Matches all VCards, that have an EMAIL property with an address in the domain example.com and at the same
     *     time a TYPE parameter with value home, and/or an N property with a surname of Mustermann.
     *
     * It is also possible to mix both forms, where string keys are used for the simple form and numeric indexes are
     * used for the elaborate form filters.
     *
     * @psalm-param SimpleConditions|ComplexConditions $conditions
     * @param array $conditions
     *  The match conditions for the query, or for one property filter. An empty array will cause all VCards to match.
     * @param bool $matchAll Whether all or any of the conditions needs to match.
