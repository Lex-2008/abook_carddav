# Using SPNEGO / GSSAPI / Kerberos authentication

The carddavclient library supports authentication using the SPNEGO mechanism, which includes the possibility to
authenticate using a kerberos ticket without the need for a password.

## Prerequisites

- PHP curl extension with GSSAPI/SPNEGO support and support for the authentication mechanism to use (e.g. Kerberos 5)

## Usage

If the prerequisites are available and the client-side Kerberos configuration is properly available on the client
machine (e. g. `/etc/krb5.conf`), provide the kerberos principal name as username. The password is optional in this case
(empty string). If your server provides additional authentication options in case a ticket is not available, provide the
password for that mechanism.

## Notes on server-side setup

It is quite common that CardDAV servers running inside a webserver let the webserver handle the authentication for
SPNEGO. Nextcloud does it this way, and also Sabre/DAV provides an authentication backend where the actual
authentication is carried out by Apache, allowing it to be used with any authentication mechanism that Apache supports.

Therefore, the following configuration snippet may be useful to setup Apache for use with SPNEGO / Kerberos 5. I use a
modified version of the Ba√Økal server to test the library with Kerberos authentication. This is the configuration I use
in Apache (it requires the Apache mod\_auth\_gssapi):

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName baikal.domain.com

    ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
    DocumentRoot /var/www/baikalKrb/html

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule /.well-known/carddav /dav.php [R=308,L]

    <Directory "/var/www/baikalKrb/html">
        Options None
        # If you install cloning git repository, you may need the following
        # Options +FollowSymlinks
        AllowOverride None

        AuthType GSSAPI
        AuthName "GSSAPI Logon"

        # The server needs access to its kerberos key in the keytab
        # It should contain a service principal like HTTP/baikal.domain.com@REALM
        GssapiCredStore keytab:/etc/apache2/apache.keytab

        # The following enables server-side support for credential delegation (not that it needs to
        # be enabled on the client-side as well, if desired. You need to specify a directory that the
        # webserver can write to
        # GSSAPI delegation enables the server to acquire tickets for additional backend services. For
        # a CardDAV server, you will not normally need this. For a different service like roundcube
        # webmail, this would enable the webmail client for example to authenticate on the user's behalf
        # with backend IMAP, SMTP or CardDAV servers.
        # GssapiDelegCcacheDir /var/run/apache2/krbclientcache

        # maps the kerberos principal to a local username based on the settings in /etc/krb5.conf
        # e. g. username@REALM -> username
        GssapiLocalName On

        # Restrict the mechanisms offered by SPNEGO to Kerberos 5
        GssapiAllowedMech krb5

        # Optional: The following allows to fallback to Basic authentication if no ticket is available.
        # In this case, the username and kerberos password are required and the webserver would use them
        # to acquire a ticket-granting ticket for the user from the KDC itself.
        #GssapiBasicAuth On
        #GssapiBasicAuthMech krb5

        Require valid-user
    </Directory>

    <IfModule mod_expires.c>
        ExpiresActive Off
    </IfModule>
</VirtualHost>
